# IntegralImage
Exercise for integral image.
* Implementation 1: Naive method  
Time complexity is O(n^4).  
* Implementation 2: Use the sum of previous pixels  
Time complexity is O(n^2).  
* Implementation 3: Add zero padding to remove if statement in the loop  
Time complexity is O(n^2), but faster than Impl 2.
